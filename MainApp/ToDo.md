# To Do List

- Effort Sizing: 5 point rating scheme used to determine how important an item is
  - 1: is the lowest rating, 5: is the highest
- Labels:
  - [Bug] use for bugs where something does not work as expected or produces an incorrect result
  - [Dev] implementing fixes to bugs or updating code
  - use `**` to close items

## app.java

## Command.java

- [Bug] When using a name with a single character, like 'I'm w Ammad', it will throw an error since it detects 'w' as an invalid command. Only occurs if the single character is not beside a single quote

## CreateEvent.java

- [Dev] If event timing conflicts with other events, notfiy user what events are having conflicts
  - Look into verifyTimeInput() where it checks the startTime and endTime
  - Events that are labelled as <All-Day> should be displayed too
- [Dev] Time inputs should only be 15-minute intervals
